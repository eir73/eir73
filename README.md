## 🚀 What I’ve Been Up To

- **Frontend development** is my bread and butter. I’ve spent the past few years building everything from dashboards to real-time apps using **Vue.js** and **Node.js**. Along the way, I’ve picked up a thing or two about making apps **perform better** and **scaling** them to handle more users.
- I’ve led efforts in **CI/CD** setup and automation—using tools like **Jenkins**, **Docker**, and **git hooks** — to make sure deployments are smooth and fast.
- Oh, and I love working with real-time data! I’ve spent a lot of time **optimizing WebSocket** communication, reducing payload sizes, and boosting app performance.
- Whether it's small personal projects or working with teams, I’m all about collaboration — helping others, reviewing code, and always looking for ways to improve.
